                  <p>
                    My current obsession in mobile involves proficiency in the native space!

                    At work I develop features for the Google Play Store using the latest and
                    greatest in Android. That means MVVM, Kotlin, and declarative UI programming :)

                    On my free time, I develop using the latest in iOS (Swift, SwiftUI) using similar
                    MVVM architecture.

                    I plan on getting a thorough understanding of these two platforms before diving into
                    the cross platform world (Flutter, more than likely).

                    Python is my go to language for algorithms practice and scripting. It's 
                    type hinting and straightforward syntax always keep me coming back for more :)

                    Along with this site, I have been building small scale web apps since college
                    (December 2019) using HTML/CSS/JS using Node as the backend with Express and SQL
                    for server and database management, respectively. I see web development as an essential
                    tool for any software engineer and one that must be constantly honed.

                    At work I dabble in the Spring Java Framework for the back end
                    and Angular for the front end developing the UI for the firm's certification application,
                    Digicerts.

                <p>
                  I was raised in South Texas, and attended college there at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. 
                  I caught the software bug late into my mechanical engineering undergraduate career through the blog of my 
                  unofficial mentor at the time, Haseeb Qureshi. He painted a career in my mind of invention and impact that was
                  so engaging, I had to give it a shot despite graduation looming in the distance. I started with some
                  tutorials in the Ruby programming language in my spare time and from then on was pretty rapidly hooked, 
                  I'm happy to say!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fast forward to the present, and I'm now a professional software engineer at Google. The gratitude I feel
                  at this point can probably only be matched by how much I still don't know about this incredible field. 
                  Currently, my fascinations extend past the already mentioned to the emerging field of crypto/blockchain 
                  and how governance will change as a result of these amazing technologies.
