                  <h3>iOS Full Stack</h3>
                  <p>
                    My current learning obsession is mobile iOS app development in iOS 13 with Swift 5.
                    I intend to be procifient enough to build some of the project apps I have in mind
                    in 3 months or less, pending work at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My first foray into mobile development was with the open source cross
                    platform mobile framework being developed by Google, "Flutter". Since then,
                    I've realized that the proper path to mobile mastery was excellence in the
                    native space first. I chose iOS because of the syntax of the Swift language
                    and the excellent mobile ecosystem that Apple has developed. I'm currently
                    working through Angela Yu's excellent Udemy course on iOS engineering to
                    round out my proficiency.

                  <h3>Python Backend Development</h3>
                  <p>
                    Python is by far my strongest language, and for good reason. It's expressiveness
                    and concise syntax makes it my go to for backend tooling that pulls several
                    systems together into unified functionality. Python is my first choice language
                    for quick algorithm implementations during software engineering interviews,
                    and of course it is the de facto Machine Learning language (another of my interests)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At work I mostly use Python to develop orchestration and automation tools for
                    client software engineers in the firm and to make life easier for the engineers on
                    my team.

                  <h3>Full Stack Web Development</h3>
                  <p>
                    Along with this site, I have been building small scale web apps since college
                    (December 2019) using HTML/CSS/JS using Node as the backend with Express and SQL
                    for server and database management, respectively. I see web development as an essential
                    tool for any software engineer and one that must be constantly honed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Currently going through Angela Yu's excellent Udemy course on Web Development to round out my
                    knowledge. At work I dabble in the Spring Java Framework for the back end
                    and Angular for the front end developing automation apps for client
                    software engineers at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

                  <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
                  <p>
                    I have been studying and working with Machine Learning model pipelines with Python
                    since senior year of college, and it is an area of software engineering
                    that fascinates me greatly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have some slight work experience in ML from a team I was
                    briefly on that worked with natural language processing pipelines for automation engineering.
                    Currently working through the Udemy course "Complete Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery"
                    by Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Burke to supplement my knowledge.

                <p>
                  I am a Mexican born immigrant from the gorgeous city of Guadalajara, Mexico. I was raised in South
                  Texas, and attended college there at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. I caught the software
                  bug late into my mechanical engineering undergraduate career through the blog of my unofficial
                  mentor at the time, Haseeb Qureshi. He painted a career in my mind of invention and impact that was
                  so engaging, I had to give it a shot despite graduation looming in the distance. I started with some
                  tutorials in the Ruby programming language in my spare time and from then on was pretty rapidly hooked, I'm happy
                  to say!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fast forward 2 years, and I'm now a professional software engineer at JP Morgan Chase & Co. The gratitude I feel
                  at this point can probably only be matched by how much I still don't know about this incredible field. Currently,
                  my fascinations include Robert C. Martin's "Clean Code", and how I'm constantly following short of that blessed ideal,
                  iOS engineering, full stack web development, and how I can actually put machine learning to work at my job/projects.
