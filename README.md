# Portfolio-Website-and-Blog

## About
---------------
My personal portfolio website where demos of my projects can be viewed. Additionally, a blog will be added soon where writings about my software engineering interests and thought can be read

## Caveats
---------------
The design and code for the website are from a tutorial I did via freecodecamp.org. I will be incrementally adding to the design and functionality from here on out as of May, 13th, 2020 onward. 

## Progress Map
---------------
- Add Blog page
- experiment with React components
- experiment with Angular framework
